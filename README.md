# Better In-Game Chat Overlay
Game chat systems suck. This overlay fixes that. It's a simple, modern and free chat system overlay for games. Inspired by the game that currently has the best chat system in the world, Overwatch.

### Most game chat systems currently:   
- Close on you for no reason   
- Close when you're on the loading screen and no way to chat while the game is loading   
- Close when you res-pawn   
- Have a chat delay bug (I hate you Valorant)   

Overwatch doesn't have these issues, and so doesn't this overlay.

### Cons of using this overlay
- Some games require you to sign a digital signature to allow full screen overlays (I hate you Valorant). This will require you to play games in borderless full screen mode which can add latency. I don't have the money to buy a signature.   
- Only probably works on Windows (The superior OS).   

### Features of this overlay
- Command system
- No filtering, reporting. You run your own chat server.
- Custom key-bind to open chat
- Press up or down to navigate through your messages (Just like a command prompt)

### How to use
- To open the chat, press the `Shift+Enter` key (Can be rebound).  
- To send a message, press the `Enter` key.  
- To close the chat, press the `Escape` or the `Shift+Enter` key.
