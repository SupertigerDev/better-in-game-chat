# Better In-Game Chat
Game chat systems suck. This overlay fixes that. It's a simple, modern and free chat system overlay for games inspired by Overwatch's chat system.

NOTE: this overlay is 10% finished and is in WIP. It currently only works with Valorant.

### Most game chat systems currently:   
- Close on you for no reason   
- Close when on the loading screen   
- Close when you res-pawn   
- Have a chat delay bug (I hate you Valorant)   

Overwatch doesn't have these issues, and so doesn't this overlay.

### Cons of using this overlay
- Some games require you to sign a digital signature to allow full screen overlays (I hate you Valorant). This will require you to play games in borderless full screen mode which can add latency. I don't have the money to buy a signature.   
- When the overlay is opened, the task bar is visible.   
- Only probably works on Windows (The superior OS).
