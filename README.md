# better-in-game-chat
Game chat systems suck. This app fixes that. It's a simple, modern, and free chat system overlay for games inspired by Overwatch.

NOTE: this overlay is 10% finished and is in WIP. It currently only works with Valorant.

![Example](/preview.png)



What most games currently do:
• Close on you for no reason   
• Chat delay (I hate you Valorant)   
• Close when on the loading screen   
• Close when you res-pawn   

Overwatch doesn't have any single of these issues, and so does this app.

## Cons of using this overlay
• Some games require you to sign a digital signature to allow full screen overlays (I hate you Valorant.). This will require you to play games in borderless full screen mode which can add latency. I don't have the money to buy a signature   
• When the overlay is opened, the task bar is visible.   
• Only probably works on Windows (The superior OS).
